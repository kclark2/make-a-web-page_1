<!-- While I originally decided to group most of my notes by lesson, in order to piece larger concepts 
together, some concepts included under earlier lesson headings are from later lessons, and vice versa.-->
<!-- I really just kind of grouped big concepts together and summerized the lesosons in the end tbh...-->

      <h3>HTML Basics</h3>
      <div class='concept-title'>
        <h4>What is HTML</h4>
        <div class='concept-description'>
          <p>
            - HTMl is the language of the web, and has syntax and rules.
            <br>
            - HTML code acts as a website's structure or framework (the walls of a metaphorical house).
            <br>
            - While not all elements are visible (ex: 'head' elements are invisible), all visible elements are rectangular.

        <h4>HTML Tags and Textual Effects</h4>
        <div class='concept-description'>
          <p>
            <b>Tags</b> are a basic HTML 'word' that the browser turns into <b>elements</b> in the 'tree.' Common tags include:
            <br>- 'p' : Designates a box around a 'paragraph,' or rather a block of text grouped together.
            <br>- 'b' : <b>Bolds</b> text.
            <br>- 'em': Used to <em>italicize</em> text.
            <br>- 'a href=' : Allows you to <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DePFiF-nNoE'>link</a> other pages' content.
            <br>- 'div' : Defines code in a box (boxes and boxes and boxes). 'Divs' are 'block' elements (instead of 'inline')
            and therefore by default, take up the entire width of the page.
          </p>

        <h4>The Importance of Structured Code</h4>
        <div class='concept-description'>
          <p>
            If your code is properly structured it is: 
            1) Easier for programmers to read, and
            2) Easier to see if you've made any mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having structured code allows programmers to easily see how certain sections of code relate to others (ex: 'x' is the overarching theme, 'y,' and 'y-description' are nested under 'x,' and so we can infer that they are conceptually related to 'x').
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class='concept'>
      <h3>Intro to HTML + CSS</h3>
      <div class='concept-title'>
        <h4>CSS: Adding Style to Code</h4>
        <div class='concept-description'>
          <p>
            CSS, or 'Cascading Style Sheets,' is another kind of code that gives your HTML (structure) code some style.
            If HTML is the walls of your house, CSS is the paint and furnishings. CSS can use mulitple sheets to determine 
            style in HTML. It's like law. There's the National, State, Municipality, and 'house' laws. However, CSS is slightly different. 
            Unlike in world law, in CSS the most specific rule is applied to every element (so 'house rules' are basically equiv. to real world National law).
          </p>
          <p>
            Using CSS code also helps you to avoid repetition in your code which not only saves you time/effort, but also decreases the chance of there 
            being error in your code. While you can apply 'style' directly to your HTML code, doing so is highy repetitive and is really only 
            good for simple/short code projects due to the high chance of error.

        <h4>Giving Elements Class Attributes</h4>
        <div class='concept-description'>
          <p>
            Class attributes (ex: 'div class='whatever'') allow you to give your HTML code 'style' by acting 
            as a reference point for the CSS code. They are like labels on moving boxes that tell you where everything
            belongs.
